I just decided to challenge myself. And read all the ["25 Computer Papers You Should Read!"](https://youtu.be/_kynGl5hr9U?si=TALJgVq1tDF21DLT){:target="_blank"} from ByteByteGo, and write a short post on my thoughts after each paper. Target timeline: 1 week for each paper and article. All the posts will be posted here, in [Telegram channel](https://t.me/off77th_IT){:target="_blank"}, and [Twitter](https://x.com/77th_en){:target="_blank"}. Subscribe to not miss the future posts!
