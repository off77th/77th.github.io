Have you ever thought that every person on the planet has a unique life experience? 
It's almost impossible to see something exactly in the same way any other person sees it. Then why we are trying to teach a lot of groups of humanity using the same approach for all?

IT tech articles in English and other communities..."Best 2023 IT courses", "Top 10 books for developers", "Top 5 programming languages to learn", etc.
Really? Pure waste of time.

We don't need more books or more courses. This is walking in circles.
We need to change our point of view on teaching anyone in this world from kids to elders, from soldiers to engineers, from the top to the fundamentals.

If you have learned something deep enough, you will be able to see anything in this world with the same depth. But only if you will accept the rule of relativity of this world. (The theory of relativity)

Humans initially learn by comparisons or by reactions (biological, physical, psychological, etc.). And a small remark, if you just memorize anything - it's not learning.
Reactions are possible only if there are at least 2 objects. We can divide anything in this world infinite times, but we always get at least 2 new objects after division. We are doing it all humanity history, huh?
Comparisons are possible only if there are at least 2 objects, and someone or something can compare them right?

So, how do all these assumptions apply to IT? Anything in IT, starting from the first assembled transistor or even earlier it's a pinnacle of the convergence of two sciences - mathematics (abstractions - logical world) and physics (forms - physical world). Then? Then only history if it's development, up to our time.
Try to keep this idea in mind while studying or working on anything related to IT. I hope it will be useful for you.

Don't try to learn anything from someone trying to teach you without proposing to you a deeper vision than you have already.

The most interesting part.
It was above.
